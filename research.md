My research focuses mainly on large-scale experiments and the development of methods/workflows for analysis of -omics data, especially in single cells. Besides high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomics in the process of regeneration, I gained experience in experiment design, statistical computing and analysis of small-sample data during my bachelor and master studies. My PHD thesis will be about highly efficient and scalable databases for all kinds of -omics data.

#### Current projects

**ADMIRE - Analysis of DNA methylation in genomic regions**

[ADMIRE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/admire) is a semi-automatic analysis pipeline and visualization tool for Infinium HumanMethylation450K Chips, that features all analysis steps from normalization to statistical testing to detect differential methylation in arbitrary genomic regions. [ADMIRE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/admire) is open-source, but can also be used online at <a href="https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de">https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de</a>

**bioALPS - application semantics for genome science**

[bioALPS](https://github.com/jenzopr/bioalps) advances the use of application programming interfaces to provide programmatic access to database resources by adding a layer of application-level semantics to the response of a service. In the git repository, we provide profiles that, together with hypermedia-aware media types, enable applications to send self-descriptive messages and characterize all possible interactions with a remote resource.

**hlap - Hoelpis library of amazing plots**

[hlap](https://github.com/jenzopr/hlap) is an R package for ggplot2-featured plots for low-level data structures (like matrices) in R. Initially, hlap was designed to be used within the MPI-HLR, but is also made available as open-source now.

**MIRPIPE - Quantification of microRNAs in niche model organisms**

[MIRPIPE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/mirpipe) is an open-source detection and quantification pipeline for small RNA datasets from high-throughput sequencing. By using the mirBase as additional input, [MIRPIPE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/mirpipe) is also suitable for nice model organisms lacking genomic information. [MIRPIPE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/mirpipe) has been integrated into Galaxy at <a href="https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de">https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de</a> but can also be executed locally.
