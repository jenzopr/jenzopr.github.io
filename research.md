My research focuses mainly on large-scale experiments and the development of methods/workflows for analysis of -omics data, especially in single cells. Besides high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomics in the process of regeneration, I gained experience in experiment design, statistical computing and analysis of small-sample data during my bachelor and master studies. My PHD thesis will be about highly efficient and scalable databases for all kinds of -omics data.

#### Current projects

**ADMIRE - Analysis of DNA methylation in genomic regions**

[ADMIRE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/admire) is a semi-automatic analysis pipeline and visualization tool for Infinium HumanMethylation450K Chips, that features all analysis steps from normalization to statistical testing to detect differential methylation in arbitrary genomic regions. [ADMIRE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/admire) is open-source, but can also be used online at <a href="https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de">https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de</a>
