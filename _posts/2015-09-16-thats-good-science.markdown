At least, this is what the first page of my brand new notebook states. No, I'm not judging my own research here, the notebook was just a giveaway from the [German Stem Cell Network](http://www.gscn.org/Conferences/2015/Home.aspx) conference last week in Frankfurt and in some way inspired me to start keeping notes related to my work, ideas and projects.
The beautiful cover shows some Petri dishes with names of dyes, from which I only heard GFP before -  not a shame for a computational biologist, who spends most of the time in front of a white screen with black letters on it. 
But Hold on! Sometimes its even a black screen with colored letters on it - indicating a source code and a (hopefully) productive time! 

Stay tuned!
