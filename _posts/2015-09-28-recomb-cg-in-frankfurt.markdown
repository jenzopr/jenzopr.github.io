A week from today, the [RECOMB-CG](https://applbio.biologie.uni-frankfurt.de/recombcg2015/) will take place in Frankfurt. Starting with the investigation of a
allohexaploid member of the mustard plant family, the first two sessions generally deal with scaffolding, synteny and the order of genomes. Intersting,
if you want to learn something about genome organizations! After lunch, we'll get an introduction into the concept of HOGs, i.e. nested groups of genes descending from a single ancestral gene.
The keynote promises that HOGs can be used to propagate functional knowledge from model to non-model species. Again, this could be interesting for our non-model: the newt.
After two more talks, its time for posters: I'll present a short story from our [ADMIRE](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/admire) project about differential methylation. 
A preview of my poster can be found in the header and I'll be glad to see you on **Monday, 4:30 pm at poster space 27!**

On Tuesday, the two session will deal with comparative genomics (CG), which is also a part of the conference title. The keynotes will cover genome evolution and profiling of microbial populations with shotgun metagenomics.
On Wednesday, keynotes will expand on genome evolution in bacteria and plants. During the conference, I will try to update this post with my thoughts, experiences and questions on the talks that I attended.

See you on Monday!
